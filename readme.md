# Advent of Code

My solutions to AoC puzzles.

## Note

Advent of Code [About page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) instructs to not share the input files. This is why I have not included them in this repository as plaintext. `input.enc` contains my input files encrypted with AES-256-CBC.

The encrypted input file archive is created by running `npm run input:encrypt`. To decrypt it run `npm run input:decrypt`. Both operations require a key. The key is taken from the `AOC_INPUT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

The input files are assumed to exist in the `/input` directory with the following directory structure:

```txt
ðŸ“¦ <project root>
â”” ðŸ“‚ input
   â”œ ðŸ“‚ 2015
   â”‚  â”œ ðŸ“œ 01.txt
   â”‚  â”œ ðŸ“œ 02.txt
   â”‚  â‹®
   â”‚  â”” ðŸ“œ 25.txt
   â”œ ðŸ“‚ 2016
   â”‚  â”œ ðŸ“œ 01.txt
   â”‚  â”œ ðŸ“œ 02.txt
   â”‚  â‹®
   â”‚  â”” ðŸ“œ 25.txt
   â‹®
```
